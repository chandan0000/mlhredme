-   Text Editors

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up Dart development environment

**Executing Script Online with DartPad:**
You may test your scripts online by using the online editor at <https://dartpad.dartlang.org/>. The Dart Editor executes the script and displays both HTML as well as console output. The online editor is shipped with a set of preset code samples.

**Dart Installation:**

**Install Dart on Windows:**
In this tutorial, we will provide a step by step process to get Dart installed on Windows.
Dart SDK comes as a pre-compiled version. So, download and extracting is all you need to do.

**Step 1:** Download Dart SDK
Go to Dart SDK archive page.
You can go to that page by [clicking here](https://dart.dev/tools/sdk/archive)
Download Dart SDK
Click on the Dart SDK link. The download will start immediately and a zip file will be downloaded.

**Step 2:** Extract zip file
Extract the contents of Dart SDK zip file. The contents of the folder would be as shown below.

**Step 3:**
Add Dart Path to PATH Environment Variable
As of now, you can run dart command only from bin folder of dart sdk. To run dart command from anywhere in your file system, add dart bin path to PATH environment variable.
Open Environment Variables. Under System variables, click on Path and click Edit button.
Edit environment variable window appears. Click on New and paste the dart sdk bin path as shown below.

**Step 4:** Restart Command Prompt
Close the existing command prompt window and open a new command prompt.
Just run the command:

```bash
dart --version
```

### **‚öôÔ∏è Install the Dart SDK on Linux:**

The steps of Dart installation on Linux is given below.
Before installing the Dart, if you are Debian/Ubuntu on AMD64(64-bit Intel) in your local machine, you can install the Dart through one of the following options.
Install using apt-get
Install a Debian package
Installation using apt-get

**Step 1:**
Type the following commands for a one-time setup.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -'
sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_stable.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list'
```

**Step 2:**

Type the following command in the terminal to install the Dart SDK using the `apt-get` option.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dart
```

It will successfully download the Dart SDK.

#### **‚öôÔ∏è Installation a Debian Package:**

We can download Dart SDK as a Debian package in the .deb package format. To make all Dart binaries accessible, we have to change the PATH by typing the following command.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"
```

To change the PATH for upcoming terminal sessions, use a below command:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"' >> ~/.profile
```

#### **‚öôÔ∏è Install the Dark SDK on Mac**

**Step 1:** We should have a Homebrew package manager, but if we don't have it then install the Homebrew and run the following command. It will successfully download the Dart on the Mac.

```bash
 brew tap dart-lang/dart
 brew install dart
```

**Step 2:** To verify which version we have installed, use the following command.

```bash
brew info dart
```
